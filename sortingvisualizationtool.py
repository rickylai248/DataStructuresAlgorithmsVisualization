# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
# Inspired throughout my completion in our Data Structures and Algorithm's course during university

# Beginning with sorting algorithms we learned first in-class which is inclusive of:
#   Selection Sort
#   Insertion Sort
#   Quick Sort
#   Merge Sort
# and more to come!

# Visualization tool created using Python to complement the sorting algorithmic construction file: See current work in progress above 

#testing 123
