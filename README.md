# DataStructuresAlgorithmsVisualization

Inspired from my course in Data Structures & Algorithms

Began brainstorming and implementing sorting algorithms utilized for class activities

# Beginning with sorting algorithms we learned first in-class which is inclusive of:
#   Selection Sort
#   Insertion Sort
#   Quick Sort
#   Merge Sort
# and more to come!

# Visualization tool created using Python to complement the sorting algorithmic construction file: See current work in progress above 

Includes comments for each sorting algorithm in "sortingalgorithm.py" noting the time complexity and description of each
