# DataStructuresAlgorithmsVisualization

Inspired from my course in Data Structures & Algorithms

Began brainstorming and implementing sorting algorithms utilized for class activities

# Beginning with sorting algorithms we learned first in-class which is inclusive of:
Selection Sort ( Worst Case: O(n^2), Best: 立(n^2) )
#
Insertion Sort ( O(n^2), 立(n) )
#
Quick Sort ( O(n^2), 立(n log(n)) )
#
Merge Sort ( O(n log(n), 立(n log(n)) )
#
and more to come!

# Visualization tool created using Python to complement the sorting algorithmic construction file: See current work in progress above 

Includes comments for each sorting algorithm in "sortingalgorithm.py" noting the time complexity and description of each
